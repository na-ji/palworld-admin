# Palworld Admin

Administrate your dedicated Palworld server right from the web browser. It uses RCON to communicate with the server.

## Why ?
All the RCON administration tool I found were either pretty basic or only worked on Windows. I wanted a tool that I can access from anywhere to manage my dedicated Palworld server.

## Features
- [x] Display the online player list
- [x] Kick/ban player from the player
More to come! See the [issues](https://github.com/na-ji/palworld-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for the roadmap.
